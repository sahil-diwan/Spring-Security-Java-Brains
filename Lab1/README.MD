       a. Starter Web
       b. Spring Security
       
  2. This Spring Security dependencies will take care of the Spring Security in our application.

    Spring Security Default Behavior
      1.	Adds mandatory authentication for all those URLâ€™s.
      2.	Adds login form.
      3.	Handles login error.
      4.	Creates a user and sets a default password.
      
      By default the user id and the password is 
      	User id : User
	      Password will be generated in the console.
        But we can edit this user id and credentials also by editing the application.properties
        Spring.security.user.name= foo
        Spring.security.user.password=foo
```
